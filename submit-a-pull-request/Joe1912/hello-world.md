Hello there, 
My name is Joseph(Joe).I'm studying in CS1B. I am really interested in 
becoming a developer and I am ready to work for that, and becoming a part of FOSS MEC will be huge step.Working with experienced seniors and classmates and getting thier views on the subject will surely change my perspectives and hence will enable me to contribute more to the Open Source Community.
I am currently learning Python and HTML,CSS,Java-Script. I have studied Java for 3 years. Hope to see you guys.Bye :)
